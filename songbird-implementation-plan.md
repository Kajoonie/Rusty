# Comprehensive Implementation Plan for Music Commands

## 1. Setup and Infrastructure

### Create a Songbird Manager ✅
- Implemented a `MusicManager` struct to handle Songbird instances
  - Created in `src/commands/music/utils/music_manager.rs`
  - Implemented methods for joining/leaving voice channels
  - Added functions to get voice channel information
  - Set up proper error handling with custom `MusicError` enum
  - Implemented utility functions for getting Songbird instances and call handles

### Implement Audio Source Handling
- Set up YouTube-dl/yt-dlp integration for fetching audio from YouTube
- Create utilities for handling direct audio URLs
- Implement audio source validation and error handling

## 2. Core Music Functionality

### Play Command Implementation
- Join the user's voice channel if not already connected
- Process the input query (URL or search term)
- For URLs: directly fetch and play the audio
- For search terms: use YouTube search API to find and play the first result
- Add proper error handling for unavailable videos or connection issues
- Implement track metadata extraction (title, duration, etc.)

### Queue Management
- Create a queue data structure to store upcoming tracks
- Implement methods to add, remove, and view queue items
- Set up automatic playback of the next song when current one ends
- Add persistence to prevent queue loss on bot restart

### Skip Command Implementation
- Skip the current track and play the next one in queue
- Handle edge cases (empty queue, last track, etc.)
- Add optional functionality to skip to a specific position in the queue

### Stop Command Implementation
- Stop the current playback
- Clear the queue
- Keep the bot in the voice channel

### Leave Command Implementation
- Disconnect from the voice channel
- Clean up resources and clear the queue

## 3. Enhanced Features

### Track Information Display
- Create rich embeds showing current track information
- Display progress bars or timestamps
- Show thumbnail images from YouTube videos

### User Controls
- Implement volume control
- Add pause/resume functionality
- Add seeking within tracks (if supported)

### Multiple Server Support
- Ensure music playback works independently across different Discord servers
- Implement per-guild queue management

## 4. Error Handling and Edge Cases

### Robust Error Handling
- Handle network issues gracefully
- Manage voice connection problems
- Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures

### Permission Checks
- Verify the bot has necessary permissions to join voice channels
- Check if users have permission to control the bot
- Handle permission errors with informative messages

## 5. Testing and Optimization

### Testing Plan
- Test each command individually
- Test edge cases (empty queue, disconnections, etc.)
- Test with various audio sources (YouTube, direct URLs, etc.)

### Performance Optimization
- Optimize resource usage for long-running audio streams
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Ensure memory usage remains stable during extended playback

## Implementation Steps in Order

1. **First Phase: Core Infrastructure**
   - Set up Songbird manager and voice connection handling
   - Implement basic audio source handling
   - Create the queue data structure

2. **Second Phase: Basic Commands**
   - Implement the play command with URL support
   - Add basic queue management
   - Implement leave command

3. **Third Phase: Complete Core Functionality**
   - Add search functionality to play command
   - Implement skip and stop commands
   - Add track information display

4. **Fourth Phase: Enhancements**
   - Add volume control and other user controls
   - Implement multi-server support
   - Add persistence for queues

5. **Final Phase: Polish and Optimization**
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Performance optimization
   - Final testing and bug fixes
